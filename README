# Self-Organizing Map for Customer Segmentation

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains customer information from a shopping mall. The fields include:
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

We use this data to cluster customers based on their annual income and spending score using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM).

## How to Execute

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `minisom`

### Hardware Requirements
- At least 8GB of RAM.
- Multi-core CPU recommended for faster training.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python som_customer_segmentation.py
    ```
4. The results will be visualized as a SOM heatmap with customer clusters.

## Executable
The file `som_customer_segmentation.py` contains the implementation of the Self-Organizing Map. You can execute this file directly after setting up the environment.
